    <description>**SUDAO-IP-6: UMAster Amendments**

**Rationale**

Due to uncertainty in our SuperUMAn DAO - Design Principles around UMAster promotions and after feedback it was clear some amendments were needed surrounding the UMAster elections.

**Content of the Proposal**:

This document is to ratify the membership tier change process for UMAsters.

* Change the UMAster election time period from every six weeks to every quarter.
* If an UMAster gets outvoted during the UMAster election process they get redesignated as a Core SuperUMAn which is solely for compensation purposes.
* Update the UMAster membership tier change process from being only self-nomination to either a normal nomination and/or self-nomination process. If a Core SuperUMAn or UMAster is nominated by someone else then they need to acknowledge/accept the nomination.
* Only Core SuperUMAns and current UMAsters can self-nominate or be nominated for the position of UMAster.
* Recruits are unable to vote in the UMAster elections.

**Reasoning:**

* The current election time period is very brief. Six weeks can fly by and every UMAster should be given enough time to prove themselves of their newly appointed position. Three months might still be too short of a time period but it’s a good enough middle-ground compared to the current timeframe.
* If a UMAster is outvoted during an election it makes sense for them to be considered a Core SuperUMAn instead of SuperUMAn. This eases the compensation reduction and shows them that they are still key members of the DAO. And because elections are not 100% accurate in determining the value of one’s contributions this seems like a good middle ground.
* Only Core SuperUMAns and current UMAsters should be able to become nominees in the UMAster election. This aligns with our SuperUMAns to Core SuperUMAns membership compensation change process. As you must already be a SuperUMAn to be considered for the Core SuperUMAn compensation. This ensures that all nominees have received support from at least 5 UMAsters and 3 SuperUMAns and have been active members of the DAO for at least half an epoch.
* After feedback on our current process being only self-nomination there should be an option to formally nominate as well. As long as the nominee meets the criteria of either being a Core SuperUMAn or current UMAster it won’t change how the UMAster process runs.
* Recruits are valuable members of the DAO and are the fresh blood the DAO needs to survive. The only issue is the lack of time actually spent in the DAO to make an informed decision. In alignment with the SuperUMAn to Core SuperUMAn membership tier change structure it makes sense to keep it to SuperUMAn and above can vote in the UMAster election.

**Changes to [SuperUMAn DAO - Design Principles]**

Under Mechanism for Confirming Membership Tier changes:

**From:**

1. Nominations for UMAsters open for 5 days and will be indicated by a self-nomination process through emoji, where if the number of nominations exceeds the number of spaces, a Discord poll for UMAsters will be conducted indicating number of vacancies, Those who receive the highest votes receive the UMAster places. In the event of a tie, a second poll will be run between the tied members.

**To:**

1. Nominations for UMAsters open for 5 days and will be indicated by **nomination or a self-nomination process** through emoji, where if the number of nominations exceeds the number of spaces, a Discord poll for UMAsters will be conducted indicating the number of vacancies. **If a Core SuperUMAn or UMAster is nominated by someone else then they need to accept the nomination by replying to the nomination &amp; adding their emoji reaction, to be considered for the role. Nominees may only consist of current UMAsters and Core SuperUMAns. Only SuperUMAn tier and above may vote in the election.** Those who receive the highest votes receive the UMAster places. In the event of a tie, a second poll will be run between the tied members.

**Under Becoming Umaster:**

**From:**

UMAsters are the critical elements of the DAO’s functioning and take on specific responsibilities for an area of work, either taking on a specific role or function or generally providing DAO leadership. It is expected that team leads would be UMAsters.

UMAsters should comprise no more than 20% of the membership of the DAO. The definition of an UMAster is somewhat subjective and it is recognised that members may value different qualities in different members based around their commitment and responsibility.

The promotions process will occur through a soft consensus based around a Discord poll followed by a confirmatory governance vote that will take place every six weeks with an indication of the number of vacancies available. Once the UMAsters are identified, their SuperUMAn NFT will be burnt and a new UMAster NFT will be minted and issued.

UMAsters will be re-elected every six weeks.

**UMAsters will be re-elected every quarter.**

**To be added Under Exiting the DAO after Reactivating SuperUMAn status:**

**UMAster Role Redesignation**

**In the event an existing UMAster does not get reelected during an UMAster election they will be redesignated to Core SuperUMAn which is solely a compensation level. Their UMAster NFT will be burned and replaced with a SuperUMAn NFT.**
