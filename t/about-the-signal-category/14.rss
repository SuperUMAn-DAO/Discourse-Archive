Proposals to the SuperUMAn DAO can be made in this category to obtain feedback.

If the post receives 5 likes, it can then pass to the formal proposal stage. 

If the proposal has not received 5 likes after 7 days then the topic will be closed. 

Anyone can make a proposal. Proposals will be announced on the Discord #proposal-announcements channel.

Signal proposals should be numbered with SUDAO-IP.  An example is given in SUDAO-IP 0

*note that before a proposal is posted on Discourse, it is recommended to start a discussion in the #proposals channel of Discord to gain initial feedback.*</description>
