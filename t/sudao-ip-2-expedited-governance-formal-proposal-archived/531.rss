**Expedited Governance**
Author: arcology
**Status: Stage 3 - Formal Proposal**

**Executive Summary**
This proposal adds an ‘expedited governance’ track to allow proposals which are important and under time pressure to be ratified more quickly, with some exclusions.

**This proposal is not eligible for expedited governance** (for obvious reasons).

**Rationale/Motivation**
The [current governance process](.. has a maximum timeframe of 21 days from start to finish for a prospective proposal to go through. This creates unnecessary overhead and time lost if the content of the proposal is important to the functioning of the DAO, and/or if the proposal in question is under time pressure to be executed.

An example is the delay of the enactment of Compound’s code tweaks to patch the [overcompensation token incident](.. due to the typical governance process timeframe, where an expedited governance track can help reduce the effects of loss.

**Content of the Proposal/Specification**:
The expedited governance process overrides the existing governance procedure by removing the need for an optional temperature check and compulsory signal (Stage 1 and 2), by allowing a proposal to directly enter the formal proposal phase (Stage 3) for a shorter timeframe and also proceed to Snapshot phase (Phase 4), under a shorter timeframe given that the proposal passes up to this point.

There are additional requirements to allow proposals to proceed under the expedited governance track:

1. **The proposal in question must be eligible**. As of this writing, eligibility is open for all with the following exclusions:
a. Proposals for membership status changes;
b. Proposals for compensation level changes.
2. **Authors must declare in the originating thread that they intend for the proposal to go through the expedited governance track.**
3. **The quorum for the formal proposal (Stage 3) is limited and raised to 50% for all SUs and above** (ie superUMAns and UMAsters), with a **minimum endorsement from 5 UMAsters;**
4. **The threshold for a Stage 3 passing vote needs to be a supermajority** (67% and above);
5. **The quorum for the snapshot vote (Stage 4) is 75% of voters** from Stage 3;
6. **The threshold for a Stage 4 passing vote is 80%.**
7. **Stage 3 and Stage 4 timelines can be reduced to 48 hours each.**
8. **If a vote fails in expedited governance at any point, the proposal in question cannot be placed again under expedited governance** and is required to go through the normal governance process.
