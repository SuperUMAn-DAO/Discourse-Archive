    <title>SUDAO-IP-15: Team Reporting (PASSED)</title>
    <link>..
    <description>**SUDAO-IP-15**

**Team Reporting**

**Rationale**
There is a lack of clarity of exactly what each team’s accomplishments, goals and problems/issues are. There is also a large effort that is going into better communicating internally and externally about the DAOs overall goals and accomplishments. This report that each team is tasked to create will help with initiatives such as the newsletter and keeping UMA DAO informed of the ongoings of the SuperUMAns. This will also help us be better prepared when it comes time to approach UMA DAO with our next funding proposal. Overall this will be a great exercise for each team to write down their goals, reflect on any issues, and show off their accomplishments all while bolstering our communications efforts.

**Content of the Proposal**:
This document is to create a formal process for teams to report their accomplishments and goals on a monthly basis.

* Each team will have a dedicated channel underneath #getting-started named #reports
* The report will be due on a monthly timeline, specifically the last week of each month.
* Operations will create the channels for each team and also check for reports the day after a report is due to ensure there has been a report made. If a report has not been made operations will remind the team that the report is due.
* Overall it will be up to each team to manage who is responsible for creating the report and making sure it’s posted on discord by each due date.
* It’s recommended that each team assign two people to be responsible for these reports.
* We encourage each team to set up their own google calendar to help keep track of the due dates and to help stay organized overall.
* The #reports channel should also be strictly reports and any comments made that aren’t reports will be deleted.
* Format would be simplistic: Long term goals, short term goals, accomplishments, problems/issues

**Reasoning:**

* Reports being due one a month should be enough time for teams to create their report and have conversations regarding their goals/objectives. 
* Having the #reports live under each team’s dedicated category would make it very easy for anyone to keep up with the happenings of each team.
* Operations will assist more heavily in the beginning but then play a lesser role by only reminding teams if a report is late. Ultimately each team will need to come up with how they will be putting up reports on the specified days.
* It’s highly recommended that team leads aren’t the ones actually creating these reports. The biggest role a team lead should play is helping decide who would be responsible for the reports, checking reports, and continuously coming up with goals/ iterating on goals.
* A team google calendar can help keep any important dates/deadlines in one place including when a report is due.
* The format is kept pretty generic as this isn’t meant to be a complicated exercise. It would be good to see the types of problems each team is running into as well.

**Under Structure of the SuperUMAn DAO after Preamble :**

**Team Reporting**
Each team will be self-reporting in a public channel once a month. This channel will be located beneath each teams #getting-started channels named #reports. The report will be due the last week of each month. Operations will check for reports on the last day of the month to ensure there has been a report made. If a report has not been made operations will remind the team that the report is due. There will be four pieces of information each report must have: Long term goals, Short term goals, accomplishments, and any problems/issues (if applicable).

            <p>Hey bananachain you have valid concerns! As for administrative power, we definitely considered this which is why we kept the report very simple where you could take a couple hours or have a team meeting or thread to discuss how much progress has been made towards the goal and what steps have been taken towards it so far. I think team leads should have the last say as to whether the goals are aligned with the DAOs objectives but dont necessarily have to be the ones to submit the reports.</p>
<p>The reason this has become important is because its extremely difficult to understand overall what a teams focus is and what theyre currently working on unless you are actively involved with each team. This would definitely help us from a holistic perspective determine if all teams are aligned with the goals or maybe there needs to be some shift of focus whether that be long/short term in order to help the DAO overall.</p>

            <p>Hey coach you bring up a good point! I think for the time being since each report has its own dedicated place in discord within each teams section it shouldnt be too difficult to find! But maybe we do need another tool as a backup to help with keeping things organizes and in one place. What would you suggest?</p>

            <p>Why not, but five year interval will probably be obsolete very quickly, given the pace at which the space moves. Just concerned about the amount of administrative manpower this would all need in relation to the outcome gained. Also, given this is a team report, would that not realy be the team leads responsibility ultimately, even if its drafting is being delegated?</p>

            <p>Yes, one week is not enough even for short term and two weeks are kind of in the middle. One month for short term and one year and five years for long term should be good. But we need a long term vision too. To reach longer than one epoch at the time.</p>

            <p>Hey guys! I thought about some of the feedback around the timeline and I agree one month seems like a good middle ground for submitting the reports. This should give each team enough time to figure out who will be responsible for these reports and what are their goals/objectives/any issues, etc. Thanks for the feedback!</p>
