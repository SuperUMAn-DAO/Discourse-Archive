    <description>**SUDAO-IP-20:**

**Snapshot Quorum Change**

**Rationale:**

This document is to ratify our current Snapshot Quorum as written in our SuperUMAn DAO Design Principles.

**Content of the Proposal:**

* Change snapshot quorum from needing 50% of total voting power to no quorum.
* There still needs to be a simple majority (51%) to pass a proposal through snapshot.
* Remove quorum from the “Formal Proposal and Poll” proposal stage. It will simply need a simple majority (51%) to pass.
* Change the Discourse poll minimum timeline from 5-7 days to 3-7 days which matches the Snapshot phase.

**Under Governance of the SuperUMAn DAO - Stage 3 Formal Proposal and Poll**

**From:**

A formal proposal on Discourse can be submitted once the rough proposal in the above stage has received 5 likes. The proposal may be slightly altered, however it should be transparently in the same spirit. This proposal will include a poll with three elements
- Yes
- More Discussion
- No
In order for a proposal to pass to a Snapshot vote a simple majority (51% of votes cast) is required for Yes. In order for this vote to be valid there is a quorum of 10% SuperUMAns and 3 UMAsters, with the poll running for 5-7 days. Formal proposals will be announced on a Discord announcements channel

These will be linked together with Discord providing access to Discourse governance forums to identify the membership tiers which will be reflected in Discord roles in order that the members meeting the quorum requirement can be identified. The minimum amount of time it would take for a proposal to be passed is 8 days.
